            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <hr>

            <p>Until the 16th century,[6] sharks were known to mariners as "sea dogs".[7] This is still evidential in
                several
                species termed "dogfish," or the porbeagle.

                The etymology of the word "shark" is uncertain, the most likely etymology states that the original sense
                of the word
                was that of "predator, one who preys on others" from the Dutch schurk, meaning "villain, scoundrel" (cf.
                card shark,
                loan shark, etc.), which was later applied to the fish due to its predatory behaviour.[8]

            <h2>Evolutionary history</h2>
            <hr>

            <p>Evidence for the existence of sharks dates from the Ordovician period, 450â€“420 million years ago, before
                land
                vertebrates existed and before a variety of plants had colonized the continents.[2] Only scales have
                been recovered
                from the first sharks and not all paleontologists agree that these are from true sharks, suspecting that
                these
                scales are actually those of thelodont agnathans.[11] The oldest generally accepted shark scales are
                from about 420
                million years ago, in the Silurian period.[11] The first sharks looked very different from modern
                sharks.[12] At
                this time the most common shark tooth is the cladodont, a style of thin tooth with three tines like a
                trident,
                apparently to help catch fish. The majority of modern sharks can be traced back to around 100 million
                years ago.[13]
                Most fossils are of teeth, often in large numbers. Partial skeletons and even complete fossilized
                remains have been
                discovered. Estimates suggest that sharks grow tens of thousands of teeth over a lifetime, which
                explains the
                abundant fossils. The teeth consist of easily fossilized calcium phosphate, an apatite. When a shark
                dies, the
                decomposing skeleton breaks up, scattering the apatite prisms. Preservation requires rapid burial in
                bottom
                sediments.</p>
